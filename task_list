 * test case for concurrent log truncation

 * allowing support for maximum 12 byte log_sequence_number
   * 12 byte log_sequence_number is enough for any humane task
   * make a struct of uint64_t limbs[2] and call it log sequence number
   * define its max and min values
   * implement check functions to check if it overflows on addition
   * implement compare function to compare 2 log sequence numbers
   * implement uint32_t_to_log_sequence_number and uint64_t_to_log_sequence_number
   * write methods to substract two log_sequence_numbers from it and add a uint32_t to it
   * and replace all references to it
   * keep number of bytes in log_sequence_number variable minimum 8 and maximum 16, both inclusive
