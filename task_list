 * test case for concurrent log truncation

 * implement log_seq_nr
 * allow WALe to have a variable number of bytes in its log_seq_nr representation
 * refactor WALe to use log_seq_nr
 * refactor WALe to start from any log_seq_nr, except 0, which implies read current file
 * refactor WALe to get current file size
