 * test case for concurrent log truncation

 * all read functions get_next_log_sequence_number, get_prev_log_sequence_number and get_log_record_at, will calculate and compare crc32 of the log's header at log_sequence_number in context, before returning the result
 * make sure that the log_record being read (or crc32 checked) is within bounds file_offset_of(first_log_sequence_number) <= buffer_start && buffer_end <= file_offset_of(next_log_sequence_number)
 * fix read and append_only_write functions
