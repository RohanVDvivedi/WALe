SIBLING PROJECT
 * structurally similar to WALe, call it CirLog
 * a write ahead log that works with a fixed number of blocks each of fixed size
 * first one will be the master record and all the rest will be managed as circular buffer storing log records (with checksum) each with its header (also checksummed)
 * usecase journaling for filesystems in future

FUTURE
 * test case for concurrent log truncation and discard_unflushed_log_records
