PICKED
 * implement check_equals_log_seq_nr, and refactor compare_log_seq_nr -- increases readability
 * add crc32 at the end of master record
 * add error codes to ensure valid crc32 on master record, and to calculate it on write, and validate it on read
 * add a function to get the next_log_sequence_number that will be alloted to the next record

FUTURE
 * test case for concurrent log truncation
 * allow changing the buffer block count for WALe in real time
 * add logic to fail appends, truncation and succeed all flushes, when append only buffer count is 0 OR is made 0
