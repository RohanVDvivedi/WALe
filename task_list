 * test case for concurrent log truncation

 * refactor WALe to use log_seq_nr
 * add crc32 at the end of master record
 * add error codes to ensure valid crc32 on master record, and to calculate it on write, and validate it on read
 * allow changing the buffer block count for WALe in real time
 * add a function to get the next_log_sequence_number that will be alloted to the next record
