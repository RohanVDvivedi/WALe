 * now the log sequence number = the offset of the log record in context - block_size + first_log_sequence_number
 * each log record stores the size of the current log record in the prefix and the suffix of the log record, this size also includes the 8 bytes used for the prefix and suffix

 * all uintN_t values stored on the log records are little endian
