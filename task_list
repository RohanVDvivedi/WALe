 * (always task) dry runs for all functions for locks

 * concurrent test cases, as if appending and flushing variable length logs, but some how forming a sequence
 * test case to only print all the logs from test.log, generated by the above function

 * implement concurrent truncate logs functionaity

 * (*far future) add checksum to log record, including the prefix and suffix sizes
 * (*far future) revert_to_last_flush_point
 * (*far future) revert_to_log_sequence_number
