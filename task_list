 * test case for concurrent log truncation

 * FUTURE (ONLY WHEN REQUIRED, POSTGRESQL AND MYSQL BOTH USE FIXED 64 BIT LOG SEQUENCE NUMBER, SO IT IS NOT AN URGENT REQUIREMENT)
   * implement
       struct log_seq_nr {
          uint32_t limbs[4];
       }
   * implement function to add (with overflow support, and max_limit (=0 implies no limit, else ensure that result is lesser than max_limit)), sub (with underflow support) and compare, 2 log_seq_nr
   * implement function to initialize it from an uint64_t or uint32_t
   * implement function to constants to define the min (0) and max (all 1s) log_seq_nr
   * implement function to serialize and deserialize n bytes (n <= 16) of the log_seq_nr
   * implement function to set a bit in log_seq_nr
   * allow WALe to have a variable number of bytes in its log_seq_nr representation (8 to 16 both inclusive)
   * refactor WALe to use log_seq_nr
   * refactor WALe to start from any log_seq_nr, except 0, which implies read current file
   * refactor WALe to get current file size
